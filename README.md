# Golang

Aimed at learning Golang

Here I present my own impressions and observations regarding Golang. Issues that I faced, tricks, and solutions in real development life, this is what I would like to cover here in educational form.
So, having fun with code is always a great opportunity to experiment, which is exactly what I created this repository for. So, I wish you luck and have some fun with Go :)
